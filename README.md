My first Python project! =>
# findDuplicates
Allows you to find duplicate files or directories in your pc.
Python program that can	be invoked with	the	following	options	and	arguments:
	identic [-f | -d ] [-c] [-n] [-s] [<dir1> < dir2> ..]

-f	means	look	for	identical files,	-d	means	look	for	identical
directories.	The	default	is	identical files.	

-c  Identical will	mean	the	contents	are	exactly	the	same	(note	
that	the	names	can	be	different).

-n  Identical		will	mean	the	directory/file	names are	exactly	the	
same	(note	that	the	contents can	be	different).

-s  The	size		for	each	duplicate will	also	be		printed.	The	
duplicates	should	be	printed	in	descending	order	of	size.
This	option	is	to	be	ignored	when	â€“n	option	is	used.
